## BASF Digital Farming Leverages STAC and EKS for Scalable Geospatial Data

This document details how BASF Digital Farming, through its xarvio â€“ BASF Digital Farming GmbH division, built a scalable geospatial data platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification and the open-source eoAPI ecosystem. The platform enables efficient cataloging, management, and visualization of vast amounts of geospatial data, including satellite imagery, drone data, and application maps.

### Executive Summary

BASF Digital Farming, a company focused on empowering farmers with digital agronomic tools, faced the challenge of managing and processing an ever-increasing volume of geospatial data. To address this, they developed a new platform leveraging the STAC standard and AWS services, particularly Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). This architecture has resulted in faster data onboarding, optimized storage costs, and a 50% reduction in data handling costs while processing twice as much data daily.

### Requirements and Challenges

The core need was to create a robust and scalable infrastructure capable of handling:

*   **High Data Volume:** Processing hundreds of millions of satellite images, translating into billions of geospatial artifacts.
*   **Dynamic Data Ingestion:** Handling near-daily satellite imagery from diverse sources globally.
*   **Advanced Quality Assurance:** Implementing cloud and anomaly detection algorithms.
*   **Actionable Insights:**  Transforming raw data into insights like Leaf Area Index (LAI) to optimize crop yield.
*   **Scalability and Elasticity:**  Adapting to fluctuating workloads in a data-intensive environment.

Traditional satellite data providers have predictable data flows, but BASF operates in a dynamic agricultural environment with variable data inputs.

### Solution Architecture

The solution is built on Amazon EKS as the core computing platform, utilizing other AWS services for storage, databases, and API management. The architecture is divided into four main layers:

1.  **Core Services Layer:**
    *   **stac-service:** Implements the STAC API for cataloging and serving metadata for raster and vector datasets.
    *   **raster-service:** Uses TiTiler to dynamically render and tile cloud-optimized raster data (COGs) for web and mobile map integration.
    *   **vector-service:** Uses TiPG to serve vector data as tiled MVT layers directly from the database or S3.
    These services are containerized and orchestrated within Kubernetes for high availability and simplified CI/CD.
2.  **Storage Layer:**
    *   All raw and processed geospatial assets are stored in Amazon S3.
    *   Raster imagery is stored in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) for efficient streaming access.
    *   Vector data is stored in FlatGeobuf or similar formats.
3.  **Database Layer:**
    *   A PostgreSQL database hosted on Amazon RDS is the metadata backbone.
    *   The RDS database is extended with the pgSTAC plugin for efficient indexing and querying of STAC items.
    *   An RDS proxy provides connection pooling and resiliency.
4.  **Ingestion Layer:**
    *   A decoupled ingestion component handles batch and streaming data inputs.
    *   It processes satellite imagery, drone data, and prescription maps, pushing metadata to the STAC API and assets to S3.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **Amazon EKS:** Container orchestration platform.
*   **Amazon S3:** Object storage for geospatial assets.
*   **Amazon RDS:** Relational Database Service with PostgreSQL.
*   **pgSTAC:** PostgreSQL extension for STAC API implementation.
*   **TiPG:** Tilemap PostGIS for serving vector data.
*   **TiTiler:** Dynamic tile server for raster data (COGs).
*   **Amazon API Gateway:** Provides a unified entry point for client access.
*   **KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling):** Dynamically scales platform services based on real-time workloads.
*   **STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog):** Open standard for describing and cataloging geospatial data.
*   **eoAPI:** Open-source ecosystem of tools for managing geospatial data.

### Benefits and Learnings

The new platform offers several key benefits:

*   **Rapid Onboarding:** STAC standardization reduced the time to onboard new data domains from weeks to days.
*   **Optimized Storage:** Using COGs and S3 reduced storage costs and improved streaming access.
*   **Large-Scale Ingestion:** The custom STAC ingestor supports both real-time and batch data loading at high throughput.
*   **Scalable Metadata Backbone:** pgSTAC and Amazon RDS Proxy provide efficient querying and connection management.
*   **Scalable Deployment:**  EKS and KEDA enable dynamic scaling based on demand.

**Key Learnings:**

*   **RDS Proxy is essential:**  Handles connection pooling and prevents connection exhaustion under high load.
*   **Custom STAC ingestor is crucial:** Facilitates large-scale, automated data onboarding.
*   **COGs are indispensable:** Enable efficient visualization and are essential for large raster datasets.
*   **EKS is preferred over serverless:** Provides necessary environment tuning for components like TiTiler and TiPG.

### Conclusion

BASF Digital Farming successfully implemented a STAC-based geospatial data platform on Amazon EKS, enabling efficient management and visualization of vast datasets. The architecture resulted in significant improvements in data onboarding speed, cost optimization, and scalability. The adoption of the STAC standard and AWS services provides a robust and cost-effective solution for organizations managing geospatial data.
