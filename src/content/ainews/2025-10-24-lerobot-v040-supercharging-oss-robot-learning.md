## LeRobot v0.4.0: Supercharging OSS Robot Learning

This release, LeRobot v0.4.0, marks a significant leap forward in open-source robotics, focusing on enhancing scalability, flexibility, and accessibility for robot learning. Key improvements include revamped datasets, expanded simulation environment support, a powerful new data processing pipeline, and a revolutionary plugin system for hardware integration.  The release also introduces new state-of-the-art VLA policies (pi0, pi0.5, and GR00T N1.5) and a comprehensive learning course.

### Overview

LeRobot v0.4.0 focuses on making robot learning more powerful, scalable, and user-friendly. The release introduces several key features:

*   **Scalable Datasets:** New `LeRobotDataset v3.0` with chunked episodes and streaming capabilities.
*   **Expanded Simulation Environments:** Support for LIBERO and Meta-World.
*   **Flexible Codebase:** New `Processors` pipeline for data handling and simplified multi-GPU training.
*   **Hardware Integration:**  A new plugin system for easy integration of third-party hardware.
*   **Advanced Policies:** Integration of PI0, PI0.5, and GR00T N1.5 VLA policies.
*   **Educational Resources:** A new, open-source Hugging Face Robot Learning Course.

## Datasets: Ready for the Next Wave of Large-Scale Robot Learning

LeRobot v0.4.0 introduces a completely overhauled dataset infrastructure with **LeRobotDataset v3.0**. This update is designed to handle massive datasets efficiently.

### Key Features of LeRobotDataset v3.0:

*   **Chunked Episodes:** Supports datasets exceeding 400GB, enabling unprecedented scalability (e.g., OXE).
*   **Efficient Video Storage & Streaming:**  Faster loading and seamless streaming of video data.
*   **Unified Parquet Metadata:**  All episode metadata stored in structured Parquet files for easier management.
*   **Improved Performance:** Reduced dataset initialization times and more efficient memory usage.

**Impact:** This update significantly improves the scalability and efficiency of working with large-scale robot datasets, opening up new possibilities for training more complex and capable robot policies.

**Conversion Script:** A conversion script is provided to migrate existing v2.1 datasets to the new v3.0 format.

### New Feature: Dataset Editing Tools

The release includes `lerobot-edit-dataset`, a CLI tool for flexible dataset manipulation:

*   **Delete Episodes:** Remove specific episodes from datasets.
*   **Split Datasets:** Divide datasets by fractions or episode indices.
*   **Add/Remove Features:** Easily modify the features within datasets.
*   **Merge Datasets:** Combine multiple datasets into a single unified dataset.

**Impact:**  These tools streamline dataset curation and optimization, allowing researchers and developers to easily prepare datasets for training.

## Simulation Environments: Expanding Your Training Grounds

LeRobot v0.4.0 expands its simulation capabilities with support for two new benchmarks:

### LIBERO Support

LeRobot now officially supports LIBERO, a large open benchmark for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies, containing over 130 tasks.

**Impact:** LIBERO provides a standardized evaluation hub for VLA policies, enabling easy integration and comparison.

### Meta-World Integration

Integration with Meta-World, a benchmark for testing multi-task and generalization abilities in robotic manipulation, is included.

**Impact:** Meta-World allows for evaluating the generalization capabilities of robot policies across diverse manipulation tasks.

## Codebase: Powerful Tools For Everyone

LeRobot v0.4.0 introduces significant improvements to its codebase, making data processing and training more flexible and accessible.

### The New Pipeline for Data Processing

The introduction of **Processors** provides a modular pipeline for data handling.  Processors act as a "translator" between raw data and the expected format for AI models and robot hardware.

*   **PolicyProcessorPipeline:** Designed for models, handling batched tensors for training and inference.
*   **RobotProcessorPipeline:** Designed for hardware, processing individual data points for real-time control.

**Impact:** The new pipeline simplifies data preprocessing and ensures data is in the correct format for each stage of the robot learning process.

### Multi-GPU Training Made Easy

The release simplifies multi-GPU training by integrating Accelerate directly into the training pipeline.

**Command:**

```
accelerate launch \
--multi_gpu \
--num_processes=$NUM_GPUs \
$(which lerobot-train) \
--dataset.repo_id=${HF_USER}/my_dataset \
--policy.repo_id=${HF_USER}/my_trained_policy \
--policy.type=$POLICY_TYPE \
# ... More training configuration flags
```

**Impact:** This simplifies distributed training, reducing training time significantly (up to 2x with 2 GPUs, 3x with 3 GPUs).

## Policies: Unleashing Open-World Generalization

LeRobot v0.4.0 integrates several state-of-the-art VLA policies:

### PI0 and PI0.5

Integration of PI0 and PI0.5 policies from Physical Intelligence.

*   **Open-World Generalization:** Adapts to new environments and situations.
*   **Co-training on Heterogeneous Data:** Learns from diverse data sources.

**Impact:** PI0 and PI0.5 represent a significant step towards achieving true open-world generalization in robotics.

### GR00T N1.5

Integration of NVIDIA's GR00T N1.5 model.

*   **Generalized Reasoning & Skills:**  Excels at reasoning and manipulation tasks.
*   **Extensive Training Data:** Trained on a massive dataset combining real and synthetic data.

**Impact:** GR00T N1.5 provides a powerful foundation model for various robotic tasks.

## Robots: A New Era of Hardware Integration with the Plugin System

A new plugin system allows for easy integration of third-party hardware.

*   **Extensibility:** Develop custom hardware components as separate packages.
*   **Scalability:** Supports a growing ecosystem of devices without modifying the core library.
*   **Community-Friendly:** Lowers the barrier to entry for community contributions.

**Impact:** The plugin system significantly simplifies hardware integration, fostering a more collaborative and extensible ecosystem.

**Reachy 2 Integration:**  Support for Pollen Robotics' Reachy 2 is added.

**Phone Teleoperation:** Enables teleoperation of robots from iOS/Android devices.

## The Hugging Face Robot Learning Course

A new, self-paced, open-source course is launched to teach robot learning fundamentals.

**Topics Covered:**

*   Fundamentals of robotics
*   Generative models for imitation learning
*   Reinforcement Learning
*   Generalist policies (PI0, PI0.5)

**Impact:**  The course makes robot learning accessible to a wider audience.

## Final thoughts from the team

The team expresses gratitude to the community for contributions and feedback.  They emphasize the importance of collaboration and look forward to future developments.
