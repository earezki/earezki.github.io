## Main Heading (essence of the article)

Qilin ransomware, operating as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, has emerged as a major cyber threat, targeting over 84 victims monthly in 2025 by exploiting remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools, stolen credentials, and a novel "bring your own vulnerable driver" (BYOVD) technique. The group’s attacks leverage both Windows and Linux systems, disrupting critical infrastructure and backup systems.

## Attack Statistics and Impact

- **Victim Count**:  
  - 84 victims monthly in August and September 2025, peaking at 100 victims in June 2025.  
  - Over 40 victims monthly since July 2022, excluding January 2025.  

- **Geographic Targets**:  
  - U.S., Canada, U.K., France, and Germany are the most impacted countries.  

- **Sector Distribution**:  
  - Manufacturing (23%), professional/scientific services (18%), and wholesale trade (10%).  

- **Financial and Operational Impact**:  
  - Disruption of backup systems (e.g., Veeam) compromises disaster recovery.  
  - Encryption of files and deletion of shadow copies prevent data recovery.

## Attack Methodology

### Initial Access and Credential Harvesting
- **Leaked Credentials**: Attackers use stolen administrative credentials from the dark web to access systems via VPN and RDP.  
- **Credential Extraction Tools**:  
  - Mimikatz, WebBrowserPassView.exe, BypassCredGuard.exe, and SharpDecryptPwd are used to extract passwords from Chrome, RDP, SSH, and Citrix.  
  - Stolen credentials enable lateral movement and privilege escalation.  

### Network Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement
- **Tools for Reconnaissance**:  
  - `mspaint.exe`, `notepad.exe`, `iexplore.exe` are used to inspect files for sensitive data.  
  - Cyberduck is employed for file transfers to remote servers, masking malicious activity.  
- **RMM Tools for Lateral Movement**:  
  - AnyDesk, Chrome Remote Desktop, Distant Desktop, GoToDesk, QuickAssist, and ScreenConnect are installed to move across networks.  

### Evasion Techniques
- **Security Bypasses**:  
  - PowerShell commands disable AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) and TLS certificate validation.  
  - Tools like `dark-kill`, `HRSword`, Cobalt Strike, and SystemBC are used to terminate security software and maintain persistent access.  
- **BYOVD Exploit**:  
  - The `eskle.sys` driver is deployed to disable security solutions, terminate processes, and evade detection.  

### Ransomware Deployment
- **Hybrid Attack Strategy**:  
  - Linux ransomware variant is deployed on Windows systems using WinSCP and Splashtop Remote’s `SRManager.exe`.  
  - The Linux payload enables cross-platform encryption, targeting both Windows and Linux systems.  
- **Post-Attack Actions**:  
  - Event logs are wiped, and Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) shadow copies are deleted.  
  - Ransom notes are dropped in encrypted folders, demanding payment in cryptocurrency.

## Targeted Infrastructure and Tools

- **Veeam Backup Systems**:  
  - Credential extraction tools are used to compromise backup infrastructure, undermining disaster recovery.  
- **Splashtop and ScreenConnect**:  
  - Exploited for final ransomware execution and command execution.  
- **Cloudflare R2 Infrastructure**:  
  - Used to host fake CAPTCHA pages for spear-phishing campaigns.  

---

## Advanced Techniques and Adaptations

- **BYOVD Exploit**:  
  - Attackers use legitimate drivers (e.g., `eskle.sys`) to bypass security defenses.  
- **Cross-Platform Capabilities**:  
  - Linux ransomware binaries are deployed via PuTTY SSH clients to Linux systems.  
- **Hyperconverged Infrastructure Targeting**:  
  - Updated samples include Nutanix AHV detection, expanding attacks to hyperconverged environments.

## Working Example (if code-related)

**Note**: The context does not include direct code examples. However, the use of PowerShell commands to disable AMSI is illustrative of evasion techniques:

```powershell
# Example PowerShell command to disable AMSI (for educational purposes only)
$AmsiContext = [Ref].Assembly.GetType("System.Management.Automation.AmsiContext")
$AmsiContext.GetField("amsiContext", [System.Reflection.BindingFlags]::NonPublic -bor [System.Reflection.BindingFlags]::Instance).SetValue($AmsiContext, $null)
```

**Explanation**: This script disables AMSI, a Windows security feature that detects malicious scripts. Attackers use such commands to evade detection by endpoint security tools.

## Recommendations

- **Preventive Measures**:  
  - Regularly update and patch RMM tools (e.g., Atera, ScreenConnect).  
  - Monitor for unusual activity in RDP and SSH logs.  
  - Implement strict access controls for backup systems (e.g., Veeam).  

- **Detection and Response**:  
  - Deploy tools to detect AMSI bypasses and BYOVD driver usage.  
  - Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to monitor lateral movement.  

- **Mitigation Strategies**:  
  - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access.  
  - Regularly back up data and test recovery processes.  
  - Educate employees on phishing and social engineering attacks.  

- **Avoid Common Pitfalls**:  
  - Do not use unpatched RMM tools or third-party remote access software.  
  - Avoid storing sensitive credentials in plaintext or unsecured databases.
