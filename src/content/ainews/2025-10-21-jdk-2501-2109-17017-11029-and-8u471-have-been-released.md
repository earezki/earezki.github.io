## JavaScript Dependency for Site Operation

This document outlines the requirement for enabling JavaScript in a web browser to ensure the full functionality of the website. The site's intended features and content rely on JavaScript execution.

### Core Functionality Reliance

*   **Nature:** The website's core features are built upon JavaScript. These features are not available without JavaScript being enabled.
*   **Purpose:** JavaScript is used to create interactive elements, dynamic content updates, and overall user experience enhancements.
*   **Impact:** Without JavaScript, the website will likely display as static content, lacking interactive elements and potentially rendering incorrectly or incompletely.

*   **Specific Detail:** The message "This site requires JavaScript to be enabled" directly indicates the dependency. This message is displayed to users when JavaScript is disabled.
*   **Impact:** This informs the user about the prerequisite for optimal site experience.

### User Action Required

*   **Action:** Users must enable JavaScript in their web browser settings to access the full functionality of the site.
*   **Details:** The exact steps for enabling JavaScript vary depending on the browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). Users are responsible for configuring their browser settings.
*   **Impact:** Enabling JavaScript allows the website to function as intended, providing the expected user experience.
