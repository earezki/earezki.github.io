## Main Heading

This article explains how to calculate the difference between two angles in Java using three distinct approaches: **absolute difference**, **shortest difference**, and **sign-preserving shortest difference**. These methods address the circular nature of angles (e.g., 350° and 10° are 20° apart in the shortest direction) and are essential for applications in geometry, robotics, and game development.

## Angle Measurement Basics

- **Definition**: An angle measures rotation between two intersecting lines or planes.
- **Units**:
  - **Degrees**: A full circle is 360°.
  - **Radians**: A full circle is $2\pi$ radians. Java's `Math` library uses radians for trigonometric functions.
- **Normalization**: Angles are often normalized to the range $[0, 360)$ to handle circularity.

## Methods for Calculating Angle Differences

### 1. Absolute Difference

- **Purpose**: Computes the magnitude of the difference between two angles without considering direction.
- **Range**: $[0, 2\pi]$ or $[0, 360°]$.
- **Example**: The absolute difference between 10° and 300° is $|10 - 300| = 290°$.
- **Implementation**:
  ```java
  public static double absoluteDifference(double angle1, double angle2) {
      return Math.abs(angle1 - angle2);
  }
  ```

---

### 2. Shortest Difference

- **Purpose**: Finds the smallest angle of rotation from one angle to another, ignoring direction.
- **Range**: $[0, 180°]$ or $[0, \pi]$.
- **Example**: The shortest difference between 10° and 300° is $70°$ (since rotating 70° clockwise from 10° reaches 300°).
- **Implementation**:
  ```java
  public static double normalizeAngle(double angle) {
      return (angle % 360 + 360) % 360; // Ensures angle is in [0, 360)
  }

  public static double shortestDifference(double angle1, double angle2) {
      double diff = absoluteDifference(normalizeAngle(angle1), normalizeAngle(angle2));
      return Math.min(diff, 360 - diff);
  }
  ```

---

### 3. Sign-Preserving Shortest Difference

- **Purpose**: Determines the shortest angular difference while preserving the direction of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise).
- **Range**: $(-180°, 180°]$.
- **Example**: The signed shortest difference between 10° and 300° is $-70°$ (clockwise) or $290°$ (counterclockwise).
- **Implementation**:
  ```java
  public static double signedShortestDifference(double angle1, double angle2) {
      double normalizedAngle1 = normalizeAngle(angle1);
      double normalizedAngle2 = normalizeAngle(angle2);
      double diff = normalizedAngle2 - normalizedAngle1;
      if (diff > 180) {
          return diff - 360;
      } else if (diff < -180) {
          return diff + 360;
      } else {
          return diff;
      }
  }
  ```

## Working Example

```java
public class AngleDifferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double angle1 = 10.0;
        double angle2 = 300.0;

        System.out.println("Absolute Difference: " + absoluteDifference(angle1, angle2));
        System.out.println("Shortest Difference: " + shortestDifference(angle1, angle2));
        System.out.println("Signed Shortest Difference: " + signedShortestDifference(angle1, angle2));
    }

    // Include the methods from above
}
```

**Output**:
```
Absolute Difference: 290.0
Shortest Difference: 70.0
Signed Shortest Difference: -70.0
```

## Recommendations

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Absolute Difference**: For scenarios where only magnitude matters (e.g., distance calculations).
  - **Shortest Difference**: For applications requiring minimal rotation (e.g., robotics, animation).
  - **Sign-Preserving Shortest Difference**: When direction (clockwise/counterclockwise) is critical (e.g., navigation systems).
- **Best Practices**:
  - Always normalize angles to $[0, 360)$ before calculations.
  - Use radians for trigonometric operations in Java (via `Math.toRadians()`).
- **Pitfalls**:
  - Forgetting to normalize angles, leading to incorrect results (e.g., 370° is equivalent to 10°).
  - Misinterpreting the sign in `signedShortestDifference()` for directional logic.
