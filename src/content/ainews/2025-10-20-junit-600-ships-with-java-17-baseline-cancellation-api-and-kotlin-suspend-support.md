## JUnit 6.0.0: A Major Update for Modern Testing

JUnit 6.0.0, released on September 30, 2025, represents a significant step forward for the JUnit testing framework. This release brings several key improvements, including a minimum requirement of Java 17 (and Kotlin 2.2 for Kotlin test code), native support for Kotlin suspend tests, and a revamped CancellationToken API for improved test execution control.  The release also marks the deprecation of the JUnit 4 runner (junit-platform-runner), emphasizing a move towards modern JUnit platform integrations.

### Key Features and Enhancements

JUnit 6.0.0 introduces a range of features aimed at enhancing developer productivity, test performance, and overall testing capabilities.

**1. Java 17 Baseline and Kotlin 2.2 Support:**
- **Details:** JUnit 6.0.0 mandates Java 17 as the minimum runtime requirement.  Kotlin test code now requires Kotlin version 2.2.
- **Nature & Purpose:** This ensures compatibility with the latest Java features and libraries, allowing developers to leverage modern language capabilities in their tests.
- **Impact:** Developers need to ensure their project's Java version meets the requirement to utilize JUnit 6.0.0.

**2. Native Kotlin Suspend Test Support:**
- **Details:**  JUnit 6.0.0 provides direct support for Kotlin suspend functions within tests. Developers can now declare `@Test` methods as `suspend` and call suspending APIs directly, eliminating the need for `runBlocking` boilerplate.
- **Nature & Purpose:**  This simplifies testing of asynchronous Kotlin code, making tests more readable and closely resembling production code.
- **Impact:**  Kotlin developers benefit from a more streamlined and intuitive testing experience.  The code example demonstrates the shift from using `runBlocking` to directly calling suspending functions.

**3. CancellationToken API for Fail-Fast Execution:**
- **Details:** The release introduces a `CancellationToken` API that can be used to abort test execution on the first failure.  The `ConsoleLauncher` includes a `--fail-fast` flag that automatically wires up a listener to cancel the run upon the first failed test.
- **Nature & Purpose:** This feature improves test execution efficiency by preventing unnecessary test runs after a failure.
- **Impact:** Developers can significantly reduce test execution time, especially in large test suites. The provided code snippet demonstrates how to implement a custom `TestExecutionListener` to utilize the `CancellationToken`.

**4. Built-in Java Flight Recorder (JFR) Support:**
- **Details:**  JFR support is now integrated directly into the JUnit platform launcher under `org.junit.platform.launcher.jfr`.  Developers can start a JFR recording when launching tests without requiring additional dependencies.
- **Nature & Purpose:** JFR allows for low-overhead performance analysis of running JVM applications, providing insights into CPU usage, memory allocation, and other performance metrics.
- **Impact:** Developers can easily profile their tests to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their code.

**5. JSpecify Nullability Annotations:**
- **Details:** All JUnit modules now utilize JSpecify nullability annotations to explicitly indicate the nullability of method parameters, return types, and fields.
- **Nature & Purpose:** This enhances code clarity, improves IDE support, and enables compile-time safety checks for null values.
- **Impact:** Developers benefit from better code understanding and reduced risk of null pointer exceptions.

**6. Migration to FastCSV:**
- **Details:** JUnit 6.0.0 migrates from the unmaintained `univocity-parsers` library to `FastCSV` for parsing CSV data in `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource` annotations.
- **Nature & Purpose:**  `FastCSV` is faster, compliant with RFC 4180, has zero dependencies, and offers improved error reporting for malformed CSV data.
- **Impact:**  Improved CSV parsing performance and reliability.

**7. Deprecation of JUnit 4 Runner (junit-platform-runner):**
- **Details:** The JUnit 4 runner (`junit-platform-runner`) has been removed. Vintage remains as a temporary bridge but is now deprecated.
- **Nature & Purpose:** This signifies a shift towards modern JUnit platform integrations and encourages developers to adopt native integrations in IDEs/build tools or use Jupiter directly.
- **Impact:**  Teams using JUnit 4 need to plan migration work.  The deprecation signals the end of compatibility for JUnit 4.

### Migration Considerations

- **Teams on Java 17 and JUnit 5.14:** A simple dependency bump and a dry run are generally sufficient.  Modernize build plugins (Surefire/Failsafe ≥ 3.0) and validate CSV-driven tests.
- **Kotlin Users:**  Simplify coroutine testing with direct suspend methods.
- **Teams on JUnit 4:**  Plan migration work, as Vintage’s deprecation marks the end of that compatibility path.  Refer to the migration wiki for detailed guidance.
