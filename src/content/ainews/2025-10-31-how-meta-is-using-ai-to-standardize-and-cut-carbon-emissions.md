## Main Heading

Meta has pioneered an AI-based system to standardize and improve the accuracy of Scope 3 carbon emissions estimates across its IT hardware supply chain. This initiative combines machine learning (ML) and generative AI to address inconsistencies in emissions data, enabling more precise decarbonization planning and procurement strategies. The approach was presented at the 2025 Open Compute Project summit and aligns with Meta’s net-zero roadmap by 2030.

### Hybrid AI Pipeline for Emissions Data

Meta’s solution employs a **two-pronged AI pipeline** to enhance data quality and consistency:

- **Machine Learning for PCF Estimation**:  
  - Uses ML algorithms to identify hardware components with similar specifications and estimate their Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) when direct data is missing.  
  - Reduces reliance on incomplete or inconsistent supplier reports, improving the completeness of emissions datasets.  
  - Example: If a server component lacks PCF data, the model infers it based on analogous components with known metrics.

- **Generative AI for Taxonomy Unification**:  
  - A generative AI model classifies hardware into a shared taxonomy for Scope 3 reporting, resolving discrepancies in component naming and categorization across suppliers.  
  - For instance, suppliers might label a "memory module" as "RAM," "storage device," or "memory chip." The AI standardizes these terms under a unified schema.  
  - This reduces redundancy in emissions disclosures and ensures consistent PCF assignments for similar hardware.

### Impact on Supply Chain and Sustainability Goals

- **Standardized Reporting**:  
  - Addresses a critical challenge in Scope 3 reporting: inconsistent supplier data. By unifying terminology and classifications, Meta enables cross-organization comparisons and benchmarking.  
  - Supports open standards like the **Open Compute Project (OCP)** and the **iMasons Climate Accord**, which aim to harmonize emissions reporting across the tech industry.

- **Open Source Contributions**:  
  - Meta has open-sourced its generative AI taxonomy model to encourage adoption by suppliers and other organizations. This reduces duplication in emissions disclosures and accelerates industry-wide standardization.  
  - The model is designed to be scalable, allowing other companies to apply it to their own supply chains.

- **Net-Zero Roadmap**:  
  - This work is a key step in Meta’s 2030 net-zero emissions goal. By improving data accuracy, the company can better allocate resources for decarbonization and track progress over time.

### Broader Industry Context

Meta’s efforts align with growing industry trends of using AI for sustainability:

- **Google’s AI-Driven Optimizations**:  
  - Google’s DeepMind reduced data center cooling demand by 40% through reinforcement learning. In 2024, AI-driven optimizations (cooling, workload distribution, hardware utilization) led to a **12% drop in data center emissions**.  
  - Microsoft similarly uses ML for **power forecasting**, **grid-aware workload scheduling**, and **emissions monitoring** across Azure data centers.

- **Shift from Static to Adaptive Systems**:  
  - Earlier tools like the **Carbon Aware SDK** and **Cloud Carbon Footprint** rely on predefined rules to estimate energy use. Meta’s approach represents a shift toward **adaptive AI systems** that make real-time decisions based on environmental signals (e.g., adjusting workloads to low-carbon energy grids).

- **Data Quality as a Foundation**:  
  - All AI-driven sustainability initiatives depend on **high-quality, machine-readable emissions data**. The **Open Compute Project’s new PCF reporting schema** standardizes how vendors disclose hardware emissions, directly benefiting Meta’s AI pipeline.

### Challenges and Considerations

- **Data Availability**:  
  - The effectiveness of ML models depends on access to comprehensive supplier data. Smaller suppliers may lack the infrastructure to provide detailed PCF information, requiring incentives for participation.

- **Model Generalizability**:  
  - Generative AI models must be trained on diverse datasets to avoid biases. Meta’s open-sourced taxonomy model includes safeguards to handle regional variations in component naming and supply chain practices.

- **Adoption Barriers**:  
  - While open-sourcing the model is a step forward, adoption by suppliers may require training, integration with existing systems, and alignment with industry standards.

## Recommendations for AI in Sustainability

- **For Developers/Engineers**:  
  - Leverage open-source tools like Meta’s taxonomy model and the Carbon Aware SDK to integrate emissions-aware logic into software workflows.  
  - Prioritize **modular AI architectures** that allow easy updates as emissions data standards evolve.

- **For Organizations**:  
  - Collaborate with industry consortia (e.g., Open Compute Project) to adopt unified data schemas and avoid siloed reporting.  
  - Invest in **supplier education** to improve data quality and ensure compatibility with AI-driven systems.

- **For Policymakers**:  
  - Encourage incentives for companies to adopt AI-driven sustainability tools and share emissions data transparently.  
  - Support research into AI models that address gaps in low-income or emerging-market supply chains.
