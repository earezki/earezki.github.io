## LeRobot v0.4.0: Super Charging OSS Robotics Learning

This release, LeRobot v0.4.0, marks a significant step forward in open-source robotics learning, focusing on scalability, flexibility, and accessibility. It introduces several key upgrades, including revamped datasets, expanded simulation environments, a new plugin system for hardware integration, and streamlined training processes. The release also includes new models like PI0.5 and GR00T N1.5, and a new educational course.

### Overview

LeRobot v0.4.0 focuses on enhancing the platform's capabilities for training and deploying robot learning models.  Key improvements include:

*   **Scalable Datasets:**  Introduction of LeRobotDataset v3.0 with chunked episodes and streaming.
*   **Expanded Simulation:** Support for LIBERO and integration with Meta-World.
*   **Flexible Codebase:**  A new "Processors" pipeline for data handling and simplified multi-GPU training.
*   **Enhanced Hardware Integration:**  A new plugin system for easy integration of third-party robots.
*   **New Models:** Integration of PI0.5, PI0.5, and GR00T N1.5.
*    **Educational Resources**: Launch of a new open-source Robot Learning Course.

## Datasets: Ready for the Next Wave of Large-Scale Robot Learning

**LeRobotDataset v3.0** represents a major overhaul of the dataset infrastructure, designed to handle massive datasets efficiently.

*   **New Features:**
    *   **Chunked Episodes:** Supports datasets exceeding 400GB (e.g., OXE).
    *   **Efficient Video Storage & Streaming:** Improves loading times and data access.
    *   **Unified Parquet Metadata:**  Consolidates metadata into structured Parquet files.
    *   **Faster Loading & Better Performance:** Reduces initialization times and memory usage.
*   **Dataset Editing Tools:** The `lerobot-edit-dataset` CLI allows users to:
    *   Delete episodes
    *   Split datasets
    *   Add/remove features
    *   Merge datasets

## Simulation Environments: Expanding Your Training Grounds

LeRobot enhances its simulation capabilities with support for two prominent benchmarks:

*   **LIBERO:**  A large benchmark for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies, containing over 130 tasks.  This enables easier evaluation and integration of VLA policies.
*   **Meta-World:**  A benchmark for testing multi-task and generalization abilities in robotic manipulation, with over 50 tasks. Integration with `gymnasium ≥ 1.0.0` and `mujoco ≥ 3.0.0` ensures deterministic seeding and robust simulation.

## Codebase: Powerful Tools For Everyone

The codebase features significant improvements for data processing and training.

*   **Processors:** A new modular pipeline for data handling, acting as a "translator" between robot hardware and AI models.
    *   **PolicyProcessorPipeline:** optimized for training and inference.
    *   **RobotProcessorPipeline:** optimized for real-time robot control.
*   **Multi-GPU Training:**  Simplified distributed training using `accelerate` with a single command. This can reduce training time by a factor of 2 with 2 GPUs and up to 3 with 3 GPUs.

## Policies: Unleashing Open-World Generalization

LeRobot integrates several cutting-edge VLA models:

*   **pi0 and pi0.5 (Physical Intelligence):**  These models are designed for open-world generalization, learning from diverse data and adapting to new environments.
    *   **Key Features:** Open-world generalization, co-training on heterogeneous data, collaboration with Physical Intelligence.
*   **GR00T N1.5 (NVIDIA):**  A foundation model for generalized reasoning and skills, trained on a massive dataset.
    *   **Key Features:**  Generalized reasoning, extensive heterogeneous training data, collaboration with NVIDIA.

## Robots: A New Era of Hardware Integration with the Plugin System

A new plugin system allows for easy integration of third-party hardware.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Extensibility:** Develop custom hardware in separate packages.
    *   **Scalability:** Supports a growing ecosystem without modifying the core library.
    *   **Community-Friendly:**  Lowers the barrier to entry for community contributions.
*   **Reachy 2 Integration:**  Native support for Pollen Robotics' Reachy 2 robot.
*   **Phone Teleoperation:**  Enables teleoperation of robots from iOS/Android devices.

## The Hugging Face Robot Learning Course

A new open-source, self-paced course is available to learn about robot learning fundamentals, including:

*   Classical robotics
*   Generative models
*   Reinforcement Learning
*   Generalist policies (PI0, SmolVLA)

## Final thoughts from the team

The team expresses gratitude to the community for contributions and feedback.  Future updates are planned.
