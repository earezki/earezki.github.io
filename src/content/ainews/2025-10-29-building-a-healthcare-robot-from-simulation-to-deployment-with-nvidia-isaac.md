## Building Healthcare Robots with NVIDIA Isaac and the SO-ARM Starter Workflow

### Summary

NVIDIA Isaac for Healthcare has released a new SO-ARM starter workflow to accelerate the development and deployment of autonomous medical robots. This workflow provides a comprehensive, end-to-end pipeline for collecting data, training policies, and deploying them on real hardware, significantly reducing the time required to bring these robots to the operating room. The workflow leverages a mixed training approach, combining simulation and real-world data to overcome the limitations of each.

### Introduction

The development of medical robots has been hindered by the challenges of acquiring sufficient and diverse data. Simulation has emerged as a key solution, but translating simulated policies to real-world systems has been difficult. NVIDIA Isaac for Healthcare addresses this challenge with its developer framework, offering integrated pipelines for data collection, training, and evaluation across both simulation and hardware. The v0.4 release introduces the SO-ARM starter workflow, designed to lower the barrier to entry for MedTech developers.

### The SO-ARM Starter Workflow

The SO-ARM starter workflow provides a complete end-to-end pipeline for autonomous surgical assistance, enabling developers to:

*   **Collect Data:** Utilize the LeRobot system with the SO-ARM101 hardware to gather both real-world and synthetic data.
*   **Train Policies:** Fine-tune the GR00T N1.5 model on the combined dataset, leveraging IsaacLab's RL framework.
*   **Deploy to Hardware:** Deploy the trained policies to physical hardware for real-time inference.

This workflow emphasizes a safe and repeatable environment for training and refining robotic skills before deployment in a clinical setting.

### Technical Implementation

The workflow employs a three-stage pipeline:

1.  **Data Collection:** This involves mixed simulation and real-world teleoperation demonstrations using the SO101 and LeRobot systems.  Approximately 70 simulation episodes with diverse scenarios and environmental variations are combined with 10-20 real-world episodes for authenticity.
2.  **Model Training:** The GR00T N1.5 model is fine-tuned on the combined dataset, utilizing dual-camera vision for enhanced perception.
3.  **Policy Deployment:** Trained policies are deployed for real-time inference on physical hardware using RTI DDS communication.

A significant aspect of this workflow is the heavy reliance on synthetic data, with over 93% of the data used for policy training generated in simulation.

### Sim2Real Mixed Training Approach

The workflow combines simulation and real-world data to address the limitations of each approach.  Pure simulation often fails to capture real-world complexities, while real-world training is expensive and limited. The mixed training approach aims to create policies that generalize effectively across both domains.

### Hardware Requirements

To run the SO-ARM starter workflow, the following hardware is required:

*   **GPU:** An Ampere or later architecture GPU with â‰¥30GB VRAM is required for GR00T N1.5 inference.
*   **SO-ARM101 Follower:** A 6-DOF precision manipulator with dual-camera vision (wrist and room).
*   **SO-ARM101 Leader:** A 6-DOF teleoperation interface for expert demonstration collection.

Notably, the workflow can be run on a single DGX Spark, enabling developers to perform all simulation, training, and deployment steps on one machine.

### Data Collection Implementation

The following Python commands are used for data collection:

*   **Real-world Data:**
    ```python
    python lerobot-record \
    --robot.type=so101_follower \
    --robot.port=<follower_port_id> \
    --robot.cameras="{wrist: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 0, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30}, room: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 2, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30}}" \
    --robot.id=so101_follower_arm \
    --teleop.type=so101_leader \
    --teleop.port=<leader_port_id> \
    --teleop.id=so101_leader_arm \
    --dataset.repo_id=<user>/surgical_assistance/surgical_assistance \
    --dataset.num_episodes=15 \
    --dataset.single_task="Prepare and hand surgical instruments to surgeon"
    ```
*   **Simulation Data:**
    ```python
    # With keyboard teleoperation
    python -m simulation.environments.teleoperation_record \
    --enable_cameras \
    --record \
    --dataset_path=/path/to/save/dataset.hdf5 \
    --teleop_device=keyboard
    # With SO-ARM101 leader arm
    python -m simulation.environments.teleoperation_record \
    --port=<your_leader_arm_port_id> \
    --enable_cameras \
    --record \
    --dataset_path=/path/to/save/dataset.hdf5
    ```

### Simulation Teleoperation Controls

The workflow provides keyboard-based teleoperation controls for users without physical SO-ARM101 hardware:

*   Joint 1 (shoulder\_pan): Q (+) / U (-)
*   Joint 2 (shoulder\_lift): W (+) / I (-)
*   Joint 3 (elbow\_flex): E (+) / O (-)
*   Joint 4 (wrist\_flex): A (+) / J (-)
*   Joint 5 (wrist\_roll): S (+) / K (-)
*   Joint 6 (gripper): D (+) / L (-)
*   R Key: Reset recording environment
*   N Key: Mark episode as successful

### Model Training Pipeline

The following Python commands are used to convert and combine datasets for training:

```python
# Convert simulation data to LeRobot format
python -m training.hdf5_to_lerobot \
--repo_id=surgical_assistance_dataset \
--hdf5_path=/path/to/your/sim_dataset.hdf5 \
--task_description="Autonomous surgical instrument handling and preparation"

# Fine-tune GR00T N1.5 on mixed dataset
python -m training.gr00t_n1_5.train \
--dataset_path /path/to/your/surgical_assistance_dataset \
--output_dir /path/to/surgical_checkpoints \
--data_config so100_dualcam
```

### End-to-End Sim-Collect-Train-Eval Pipelines

IsaacLab v0.3 supports a full pipeline of simulation-based development:

*   **Generate Synthetic Data:** Teleoperate robots using keyboard or hardware controllers to capture multi-camera observations, robot states, and actions.
*   **Train and Evaluate Policies:** Utilize IsaacLab's RL framework for PPO training, leveraging parallel environments and built-in metrics.
*   **Convert Models to TensorRT:** Optimize models for production deployment, supporting dynamic shapes and multi-camera inference.
