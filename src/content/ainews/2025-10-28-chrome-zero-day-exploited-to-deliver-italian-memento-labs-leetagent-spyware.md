## Vulnerability and Exploit Details

### **CVE-2025-2783: The Exploited Flaw**
- **CVSS Score**: 8.3 (high severity)
- **Nature**: Sandbox escape vulnerability in Chromium-based browsers
- **Discovery**: Disclosed by Google in March 2025, patched by October 2025
- **Exploitation Timeline**: Active since at least **February 2024**, with Kaspersky documenting its use in **Operation ForumTroll** (2025)
- **Tracking Names**: TaxOff/Team 46 (Positive Technologies), Dante APT (F6), Prosperous Werewolf (BI.ZONE)

### **Attack Vector**
- **Delivery Method**: Phishing emails with personalized, short-lived links to the **Primakov Readings forum**
- **Trigger**: Clicking the link in Chrome or Chromium-based browsers exploits the vulnerability to achieve **remote code execution**
- **Payload**: Drops a loader to deploy **LeetAgent**, a spyware developed by Memento Labs

## Memento Labs and Its Controversial Background

### **Company Overview**
- **Founded**: April 2019 via merger of **HackingTeam** and **InTheCyber Group**
- **History**: 
  - HackingTeam was infamous for selling surveillance tools to governments, including the **Tor browser monitoring software**
  - **2015 Data Leak**: Hundreds of gigabytes of internal data, including **VectorEDK** (later used in **MosaicRegressor** UEFI bootkit)
  - **2016 License Revocation**: Italian authorities revoked its export license outside Europe

### **Recent Involvement**
- **LeetAgent**: A spyware with leetspeak-based commands, linked to **Operation ForumTroll**
- **Confirmation**: Memento Labs CEO **Paolo Lezzi** confirmed the spyware belongs to the company, attributing its misuse to a government customer using an **outdated Windows version of Dante** (a predecessor to LeetAgent)

## Spyware Capabilities and Command Set

**LeetAgent** is a highly versatile backdoor with the following command set:

- **0xC033A4D (COMMAND)**: Run command via `cmd.exe`
- **0xECEC (EXEC)**: Execute arbitrary processes
- **0x6E17A585 (GETTASKS)**: Retrieve active tasks
- **0x6177 (KILL)**: Terminate tasks
- **0xF17E09 (FILE \x09)**: Write files to disk
- **0xF17ED0 (FILE \xD0)**: Read files from disk
- **0x1213C7 (INJECT)**: Inject shellcode into processes
- **0xC04F (CONF)**: Configure communication parameters
- **0xD1E (DIE)**: Terminate the agent
- **0xCD (CD)**: Change working directory
- **0x108 (JOB)**: Harvest files with extensions like `.doc`, `.pdf`, `.xls`, etc.

**Persistence Mechanism**: COM-hijacking to ensure long-term access. Data is hidden in **font files** and obfuscated to evade detection.

## Campaign Scope and Targeting

### **Targeted Sectors**
- **Russia and Belarus**: Media outlets, universities, research centers, government agencies, financial institutions
- **Method**: **Spear-phishing** with tailored lures, not mass distribution

### **Overlap with Other APT Groups**
- **TaxOff/Team 46**: Positive Technologies linked the same exploit to deploying **Trinper** backdoor
- **Dante APT**: LeetAgent is connected to **Dante**, a spyware with advanced evasion techniques:
  - **Control Flow Obfuscation**
  - **Anti-Debugging Checks**
  - **Encrypted Strings**
  - **Windows Event Log Monitoring** to detect analysis tools

### **Evidence of Shared Infrastructure**
- Identical **COM-hijacking persistence** methods
- **Shared code** between exploit/loader and Dante
- Similar **file-system paths** and data hiding techniques

---

## Response and Implications

### **Memento Labs' Response**
- **Customer Accountability**: Confirmed one government customer used an outdated version of **Dante** (Windows)
- **Current Focus**: Developing **mobile-only** tools; advised customers to discontinue using **Windows malware**

### **Broader Implications**
- **Surveillance Tech Misuse**: Highlights how tools marketed for law enforcement are repurposed for espionage
- **Need for Patching**: Emphasizes the importance of timely updates to mitigate zero-day risks
- **Attribution Challenges**: Overlaps in tradecraft suggest possible collaboration or shared resources between groups

---

## Recommendations (for Cybersecurity Practitioners)

- **Update Software**: Apply patches promptly for browsers and operating systems
- **Monitor for Phishing**: Train users to recognize spear-phishing attempts (e.g., personalized links)
- **Inspect Font Files**: Check for anomalies in font files, which may hide malicious data
- **Limit Privileges**: Restrict execution rights to minimize the impact of potential exploits
- **Audit Third-Party Tools**: Ensure surveillance or security software from vendors like Memento Labs is up-to-date and used only for authorized purposes
