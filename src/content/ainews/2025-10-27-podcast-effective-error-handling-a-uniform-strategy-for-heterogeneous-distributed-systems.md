## Main Heading

This conversation with Jenish Shah from Netflix delves into the complexities of error handling in distributed systems, highlighting the need for a uniform approach to exceptions across different protocols and services. It explores the evolution of error handling strategies, the importance of providing informative error messages, and the development of a reusable error handling library to simplify the process.

### Introduction to Distributed Systems and Error Handling Challenges

The discussion begins with the fundamental challenge of building robust distributed systems. Jenish emphasizes that while technologies like REST were initially prevalent, the increasing complexity of microservices necessitates a more refined approach to error handling. He explains that simply using standard HTTP error codes (like 400 for bad requests or 500 for server errors) is insufficient in a distributed environment where various services and protocols are involved.

### The Evolution of Error Handling and Protocols

The conversation traces the evolution of communication protocols in microservices architectures. Initially, REST over HTTP was the standard, but the need for efficiency and specific use cases led to the adoption of gRPC for internal communication and GraphQL for aggregating data from multiple services. Jenish explains that while REST was initially a convenient choice, it lacks the granularity needed for effective error reporting in a distributed context.

### Categorizing Exceptions for Effective Handling

A key takeaway from the discussion is the importance of categorizing exceptions to provide more meaningful error information. Jenish introduces a four-category system:

*   **Authorisation:** The caller lacks permission to perform the action.
*   **Validation:** The caller provided invalid or missing information.
*   **Application:** An internal error occurred within the service logic.
*   **Dependency:** A downstream service failed.

He emphasizes that having these distinct categories allows for more targeted error handling and provides better context to both internal and external consumers of the service.

### Implementing a Uniform Error Handling Library

To address the challenges of inconsistent error handling across different protocols, Jenish developed an internal "exception" library at Netflix. This library provides a consistent way to represent different types of errors, regardless of the underlying protocol (REST, gRPC, etc.). The library includes mechanisms for:

*   **Standardized Error Codes:** Defining specific error codes for each category.
*   **Protocol-Specific Mapping:** Translating the generic error codes into protocol-specific error responses (e.g., 401 for authorisation in REST, specific gRPC error codes).
*   **Observability:** Providing tools for logging and monitoring different types of errors, including tracking frequency and context.

### The Importance of Context and Observability

Jenish highlights that simply returning a generic error code is insufficient. Providing context about the error, such as the specific category of error and relevant details, is crucial for debugging and troubleshooting. The error handling library also facilitates observability by allowing teams to track different error types and identify patterns.

### Choosing the Right Protocol for Error Handling

When choosing a protocol for communication between services, Jenish recommends:

*   **REST:** For external APIs and scenarios where human-readable responses are important.
*   **gRPC:** For high-performance internal communication where efficiency is paramount.
*   **GraphQL:** For aggregating data from multiple services and providing flexible data retrieval for clients.

The choice of protocol should also consider the specific needs of the service and the communication patterns involved.

### Conclusion: The Value of Proactive Error Handling

The conversation concludes with the emphasis that robust error handling is not just a technical detail but a crucial aspect of building reliable and user-friendly systems. By implementing a uniform approach to error handling and providing informative error messages, developers can significantly improve the resilience and maintainability of their applications. Jenish's work on the exception library at Netflix demonstrates the practical benefits of investing in proactive error handling strategies.
